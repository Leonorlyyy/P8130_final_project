- Data Description

```{r}
str(survival_df)
```

Numeric variables include `age`, `tumor_size`, `regional_node_examined`, `reginol_node_positive`, and `survival_months`.

These are continuous variables that can be used for our later regression analysis.

Categorical variables include `race`, `marital_status`, `t_stage`, `n_stage`, `x6th_stage`, `differentiate`, `grade`, `a_stage`, `estrogen_status`, `progesterone_status`, and `status`.

Then we will convert these variables into factors.


```{r}
survival_df = survival_df |>
  mutate(
    race = factor(race),
    marital_status = factor(marital_status),
    t_stage = factor(t_stage),
    n_stage = factor(n_stage),
    x6th_stage = factor(x6th_stage),
    differentiate = factor(differentiate),
    grade = factor(grade),
    a_stage = factor(a_stage),
    estrogen_status = factor(estrogen_status),
    progesterone_status = factor(progesterone_status),
    status = factor(status)
  ) |>
  mutate(
    differentiate = factor(differentiate, levels = c("Well differentiated", 
                                                     "Moderately differentiated",

The majority of patients in the dataset are White, accounting for approximately 84.82% of the total population. Black patients make up 7.23%, and patients classified as "Other" constitute 7.95%. This imbalance suggests that the dataset is heavily skewed towards White patients, which could influence the generalizability of the findings to other racial groups. 


The wide range of values in variables such as `tumor_size`, `regional_node_examined`, and `survival_months` indicates the need to explore relationships and their potential nonlinearities with survival, giving us a possible analytical regression model.

Since the two variables `grade` and `differentiate` represent the same variable with different names, we will not consider the variable `grade` in the further analysis.


```{r}
colSums(is.na(survival_df))
```

We can conclude that no missing values are present in this dataset across all variables.


```{r}
survival_df |>
  group_by(differentiate, race) |>
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = differentiate,
    values_from = count,
    values_fill = list(count = 0)
  )
```

This table shows the frequency of different levels of `differentiate` by races.




```{r}
survival_df |>
  group_by(x6th_stage, status) |>
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = status,
    values_from = count
  )
```

This table shows the frequency of different levels of `status` by 6th stage.

# Distributions of the numeric variables

```{r distribution_of_the_continuous_variables, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Distribution of the Continuous Variables"}
survival_df |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(age, tumor_size, regional_node_examined, reginol_node_positive, survival_months),
    names_to = "variable",
    values_to = "value"
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "light blue") +
  facet_wrap(variable ~ .,  scales = "free") +
    labs(title = "Distribution of the Continuous Variables",
         x = "Variables",
         y = "Frequency")
```

Most patients are aged between 40 and 70 years. The data is well spread across middle and older age groups, making it possible for age-related analysis. Therefore, age will likely be a significant predictor for later analysis.

Then is the distribution of different number of positive reginol node for each subject. Over 2500 subjects only have 1 or 2 positive reginol nodes, which is the most frequent number of positive reginol nodes. It is strongly right-skewed, so we will use the log transformation for this variable. 

The third plot maps the frequency of different number of examined regional nodes for each subject. The number of examined regional nodes for most subjects are smaller than 30, and the subjects with nearly 12 examined regional nodes are the most.

Then is the distribution of the survival months, most of the survival time are larger than 45 months.

The last one is the distribution of all tumor sizes, and most of the tumor sizes are smaller than 50 mm. We can find that the most frequent size is around 19 mm, followed by around 14 mm. This distribution is right-skewed, so we will use the log transformation for this variable.









# Bewteen Variables 


## Survival Months by Status

```{r survival_months_by_status, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Survival_Months_by_Status"}
ggplot(survival_df, aes(x = status, y = survival_months)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "light blue") +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Survival Months by Status", x = "Status", y = "Survival Months") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The Alive group has a higher median survival time (approximately 75 months) with a relatively narrow interquartile range. However, there are several outliers below 15 survival months, indicating cases of unusually short survival. In contrast, the Dead group has a lower median survival time (around 45 months) with a wider interquartile range, reflecting greater variability. Overall, survival months are significantly higher for the Alive group compared to the Dead group.


## Tumor Sizes by T_stage

```{r tumor_sizes_by_t_stage, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Tumor Sizes by T_stage"}
ggplot(survival_df, aes(x = tumor_size, y = t_stage)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "light blue") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(survival_df$tumor_size, na.rm = TRUE), by = 10)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Tumor Sizes by T_stage",
    x = "Tumor Sizes",
    y = "T_stage"
  )
```

In this plot, we explore the tumor size distribution at different T stages. From T1 to T3, as the stage changes, both the mean tumor sizes and IQR become larger. At T4 stage, the IQR of tumor sizes is much larger than others, and the mean size is smaller than the mean size at T3 stage. We notice that there are some potential outliers both ar T1 stage and T3 stage.




## Survival Months by A_stage Based on Status

```{r survival_months_by_a_stage_based_on_status, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Survival Months by A_stage Based on Status"}
ggplot(survival_df, aes(x = survival_months, y = a_stage)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "light blue") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(survival_df$survival_months, na.rm = TRUE), by = 10)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Survival Months by A_stage",
    x = "Survival Months",
    y = "A_stage"
  ) +
  facet_grid(~ status)
```

In the Regional stage, the Alive group has a higher median survival with outliers below 15 months, while the Dead group shows a lower median with no outliers. For the Distant stage, survival times are shorter overall, with the Alive group having a median of 80 months and the Dead group around 30 months, both without significant outliers. Overall, survival is longer in the Regional stage, and the Alive group shows higher survival times across both stages.



## Tumor Size by Differentiate

```{r tumor_size_by_differentiate, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Tumor Size by Differentiate"}
ggplot(survival_df, aes(x = differentiate, y = tumor_size)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Tumor Size Distribution by Differentiate",
       x = "Differentiate",
       y = "Tumor Size (mm)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


The Undifferentiated group has larger tumor sizes compared to the other categories, while the Well, Moderately, and Poorly differentiated groups show similar distributions with many smaller tumors and numerous high-value outliers.


## Relationship Between Age and Tumor Size across Status

```{r relationship_between_age_and_tumor_size_across_status, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Relationship Between Age and Tumor Size across Status"}
ggplot(survival_df, aes(x = age, y = tumor_size, color = status)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "green") +
  facet_wrap(~ status) +
    labs(title = "Relationship Between Age and Tumor Size",
         x = "Age (years)",
         y = "Tumor Size (mm)",
         color = "Status") +
    theme_minimal()

```

This figure highlights the differences in tumor size distribution and trends with age between individuals who are alive and those who are deceased. While the "Alive" group shows no significant relationship between age and tumor size, the "Dead" group exhibits a pattern where larger tumors are associated with younger ages. 



## Positive Reginol Node vs Survival Months Across Differentiate


```{r positive_reginol_node_vs_survival_months_across_differentiate}, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Positive Reginol Node vs Survival Months Across Differentiate"}
ggplot(survival_df, aes(x = reginol_node_positive, y = survival_months)) +
  geom_point(color = "light blue", size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5)  +
  facet_wrap(.~differentiate) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Positive Reginol Node and Survival Months by Differentiate",
    x = "Positive Reginol Node",
    y = "Survival Months"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

According to the trend lines, as it changes from undifferentiated to well differentiated, the negative correlation between the number of positive reginol nodes and the survival months becomes weaker. At the undifferentiated level, the correlation is strong. AS the number of positive reginol nodes increases, the survival months will decrease. 


# Transformations

```{r}
survival_df = survival_df |>
  mutate(
    log_tumor_size = log(tumor_size),
    log_reginol_node_positive = log(reginol_node_positive)
  )
```


Since variables `tumor_size` and `reginol_node_positive` are skewed to the right, we need to use the log transformation and add new variables `log_tumor_size` and `log_reginol_node_positive` for further analysis.

```{r}
survival_df |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(age, tumor_size, regional_node_examined, reginol_node_positive, survival_months),
    names_to = "variable",
    values_to = "value"
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(variable ~ .,  scales = "free")
```

# Model Building

## Preparation

```{r corr}
survival_df = 
  survival_df |>
  mutate(status = if_else(status == "Dead", 1, 0))

full_glm = glm(status ~ age + race + marital_status + t_stage + n_stage + x6th_stage +
                 differentiate + grade + a_stage + tumor_size + estrogen_status +
                 progesterone_status + regional_node_examined + reginol_node_positive, 
               data = survival_df, family = binomial)

alias(full_glm)$Complete %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%  
  rownames_to_column("aliased_variables") %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -aliased_variables,
    names_to = "aliased_with", 
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>% 
  filter(value != 0) %>% 
  select(-value)
```

First, we use variables 1-14 to build a logistic regression. In this full model, we observe that the number of each level in the variable `grade` is the same as the variable `differentiate`, and the number of level `IIIC` in the variable `x6th_stage` is exactly the same with level `N3` in the variable `n_stage`.

By looking up the relevant information on the staging system for breast cancer, we can see that the breast cancer grade (i.e. variable `grade`) is based on how much the cancer cells look like normal cells, which is highly similar to the meaning of the variable `differentiate`. Therefore, the variable `grade` can be removed from the model.

In addition, the AJCC system (variable `x6th_stage`) is based on 7 aspects: the extent (size) of the tumor (T), the spread to nearby lymph nodes (N), the spread (metastasis) to distant sites (M), Estrogen Receptor (ER) status, Progesterone Receptor (PR) status, HER2 status and grade of the cancer (G). It can be seen that some of the evaluation criteria are already included in other variables. 

However, since the AJCC system is complex and levels other than `IIIC` do not correlate with other variables, we cannot simply remove this variable from the model. We will discuss this variable further when it comes to this.

## Logistic Regression Model

### Automated Procedure

#### Forward Selection

```{r forward}
full_glm = glm(status ~ age + race + marital_status + t_stage + n_stage + x6th_stage +
                 differentiate + a_stage + tumor_size + estrogen_status +
                 progesterone_status + regional_node_examined + reginol_node_positive, 
               data = survival_df, family = binomial)

forward_glm = MASS::stepAIC(full_glm, direction = "forward", trace = FALSE)

forward_glm %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

#### Backward Elimination

```{r backward}
backward_glm = MASS::stepAIC(full_glm, direction = "backward", trace = FALSE)

backward_glm %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

#### Stepwise Regression

```{r stepwise}
stepwise_glm = MASS::stepAIC(full_glm, direction = "both", trace = FALSE)

stepwise_glm %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

The backward and stepwise procedure produced the same model.

### Criterion-based Procedure

```{r model_selection}
model_selection =
  tibble(
    type = c("full", "forward", "backward", "stepwise"),
    model = list(full_glm, forward_glm, backward_glm, stepwise_glm)
    ) %>%
  mutate(
    result = map(model, broom::glance)
    ) %>%
  unnest(result) %>%
  select(type, AIC, BIC)

model_selection %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 4, caption = "Model Selection")

final_glm = stepwise_glm
```

The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is an estimator of prediction error and thereby relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data, and models with lower AIC are generally preferred. Similarly, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is also a criterion for model selection among a finite set of models. They both resolve the overfitting problem by introducing a penalty term for the number of parameters in the model.

By comparing AIC and BIC, we can see the model given by backward elimination or stepwise regression works slightly better than the full model or forward selection model. Therefore, we will choose the former to be our "best model".

### Model Diagnostics

```{r}
vif(final_glm) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

Variance Inflation Factor is a commonly used method for detecting multicollinearity in regression models. VIF is generally calculated for the continuous variables, and Generalized Variance Inflation Factor (GVIF) is used for evaluating the multicollinearity for categorical variables.

The adjusted GVIF (i.e. GVIF^(1/(2*Df))) values are corrected for the degree of freedom and provide a scale similar to VIF. The high adjusted GVIF values (GVIF > 2) indicate the presence of moderate to strong multicollinearity.

The table shows that most variables do not show multicollinearity, with the exception of `reginol_node_positive`. Since its adjusted GVIF is not much different from 2, we will keep this variable for now.

```{r}
augment(final_glm) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .std.resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Fitted value", y = "Residual")

augment_quantile(final_glm) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .quantile.resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Fitted value", y = "Randomized quantile residual")
```

By randomizing the quantile residuals, we resolve the problem that the RVF plot always shows a pattern in logistic regression because of the binary response variable. Since in the randomized quantile residual vs. fitted value plot, the residuals distribute randomly around the 0.5 horizontal line, the residual assumption is met and the model is a good fit.

```{r}
plot(final_glm, which = 5)
```

The residual vs. leverage plot indicates that observations 3527, 1561, and 3074 may be potential outliers, but they are not necessarily influential. 

### Odds Ratios

```{r}
final_glm_summary = summary(final_glm)

final_glm_df = 
  as.data.frame(final_glm_summary$coefficients) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    odds_ratio = exp(estimate)
  ) |>
  rename(p_value = pr_z)

final_glm_df %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

### Cross Validation

```{r}
log_loss = function(actual, predicted) {
  
  -mean(actual * log(predicted) + (1 - actual) * log(1 - predicted))
  
}

glm_fit = function(data) {
  
  fit = glm(formula = status ~ age + race + marital_status + t_stage + n_stage + 
        differentiate + estrogen_status + progesterone_status + 
        regional_node_examined + reginol_node_positive, 
        family = binomial, data = data)
  
  return(fit)
  
}

cv_df = 
  crossv_kfold(survival_df, k = 10) |>
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble)
  )

cv_res_df = 
  cv_df |>
  mutate(
    final_model = map(train, \(x) glm_fit(data = x)),
    predicted_probs = map2(final_model, test, \(fit, data)
                               predict(fit, newdata = data, type = "response")),
    actual_outcomes = map(test, pull, status),
    log_loss = map2_dbl(actual_outcomes, predicted_probs, \(x, y) log_loss(x, y)),
    AUC = map2_dbl(actual_outcomes, predicted_probs, \(x, y) {
      roc_obj = roc(x, y)  
      auc(roc_obj)  
    })
  )

cv_res_df %>% 
  select(log_loss, AUC) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```


After applying 10-fold cross-validation, we evaluate the goodness of fit by log loss and AUC. The mean of log loss is `r mean(cv_res_df$log_loss)`, and the mean of AUC is `r mean(cv_res_df$AUC)`.


### Evaluation Across Races

- Evaluate the performance of your model(s). Is your model achieving similar performance
between the majority race group “White” and the minority “Black” (or “Black” + “Other”)? If not, could you try to improve the fairness (i.e., reducing the gap of prediction performance between the majority and minority) of your model(s)?

```{r eval_races}
eval_produce = function(model, df) {
  
  results = 
    df %>% 
    mutate(predicted_probs = predict(model, newdata = ., type = "response")) %>% 
    group_by(race) %>% 
    summarize(
      log_loss = log_loss(status, predicted_probs),
      AUC = {
        roc_obj = roc(status, predicted_probs)
        auc_value = auc(roc_obj)  # Extract the numeric value of AUC
        as.numeric(auc_value)
        }
      ) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    select(race, log_loss, AUC)
  
  return(results)
  
}

stra_cv_df = 
  survival_df %>%
  mutate(
    race = fct_collapse(
      race,
      "Black or other" = c("Black", "Other")  
    )
  ) %>% 
  vfold_cv(v = 10, strata = race) %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(splits, training),
    test = map(splits, testing)
  )

stra_res_df = 
  stra_cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    final_model = map(train, \(x) glm_fit(data = x)),
    results = map2(final_model, test, \(x, y) eval_produce(x, y))
  )

stra_res_df %>% 
  select(results) %>% 
  unnest(cols = c(results)) %>% 
  group_by(race) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_log_loss = mean(log_loss),
    avg_AUC = mean(AUC)
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

Low log loss and high AUC indicate better test performance.

To reduce the gap of prediction performance between the majority and minority, we can try to add an interaction term in the model.

```{r interaction}
glm_inter_fit = function(data) {
  
  fit = glm(formula = status ~ age + race + marital_status + t_stage + n_stage + 
        differentiate + estrogen_status + progesterone_status + 
        regional_node_examined + reginol_node_positive + age * race + marital_status * race, 
        family = binomial, data = data)
  
  return(fit)
  
}

inter_res_df = 
  stra_cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    final_model = map(train, \(x) glm_inter_fit(data = x)),
    results = map2(final_model, test, \(x, y) eval_produce(x, y))
  ) 

inter_res_df %>% 
  select(results) %>% 
  unnest(cols = c(results)) %>% 
  group_by(race) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_log_loss = mean(log_loss),
    avg_AUC = mean(AUC)
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

By adding interaction term `age * race` and `marital_status * race`, we can observe a decrease in log loss and an increase in AUC, which means an improve in the fairness between group “White” and the minority “Black” + “Other”.

## Survival Analysis

```{r prepare_survival}
surv_obj = Surv(time = survival_df$survival_months, event = survival_df$status)
```

### Kaplan Meier Curve

The Kaplan Meier curve graphically represent the survival rate. Time is plotted on the x-axis and the survival rate is plotted on the y-axis.

```{r km_curve}
km_fit = survfit(surv_obj ~ 1, data = survival_df)

ggsurvfit(km_fit, type = "survival", linewidth = 1) +
  labs(x = "Months", 
       y = "Overall survival",
       title = "Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve") +
  add_confidence_interval() +
  scale_ggsurvfit()
```

### Log Rank Test

The log rank test lets us test whether there is a difference in survival times between groups of patients. For example, we want to find out whether there is a significant difference in survival between patients whose cells have different degrees of differentiation.

```{r log_rank, fig.asp = .8}
log_rank_fit = survfit(surv_obj ~ differentiate, data = survival_df)


log_rank_plot = 
  ggsurvplot(log_rank_fit, data = survival_df,
           size = 1, palette = "RdBu",
           censor.shape = '|', censor.size = 2,
           conf.int = TRUE, pval = TRUE,
           ggtheme = theme_bw(),
           legend = "bottom",
           legend.title = "Legend",
           legend.labs = c("Well differentiated", "Moderately differentiated",
                           "Poorly differentiated", "Undifferentiated"))

log_rank_plot$plot +
  ggtitle("Survival Time Across Differentiated Stages") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 2))
```


### Cox Model

The limitation of KM curves and log-rank tests is that we can only test one variable at a time. To further discuss the risk factors to survival time, we will compute the cox proportional hazard model to adjusts for multiple risk factors simultaneously.

```{r cox_model}
cox_model = coxph(surv_obj ~ 
                    age + race + marital_status + t_stage + n_stage + x6th_stage +
                       differentiate + a_stage + tumor_size + estrogen_status +
                       progesterone_status + regional_node_examined + reginol_node_positive, 
                  data = as.data.frame(survival_df))
```

The cox proportional hazard model has a assumption: the survival curves for two different
strata of a risk factor must have hazard functions that are proportional over time. This assumption is satisfied when the change in hazard from one category to the next does not depend on time. That is, a person in one stratum has the same instantaneous relative risk compared to a person in a different stratum, irrespective of how much time has passed. 

We will test this assumption based on the scaled Schoenfeld residuals. Here is an interpretation of the results: When p-val < 0.05, there is evidence against the proportional hazards assumption, meaning that the HR is not constant over time. Similarly, the larger the chi-square value, the greater the violation of the assumption.

```{r cox_diagnostics}
cox.zph(cox_model) %>%
  .$table %>%
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

We can see from the table that variable `a_stage`, `estrogen_status`, `progesterone_status` are not constant over time, which means it's not proper to contain these covariates in cox regression. To reduce bias of the model, we can remove these variables and take a closer look at the result.

```{r forest_plot, fig.asp = 1.5, out.width="100%"}
cox_new_model = coxph(surv_obj ~ age + race + marital_status + t_stage + n_stage + x6th_stage +
                      differentiate + tumor_size + regional_node_examined + reginol_node_positive,
                    data = as.data.frame(survival_df))

ggforest(cox_new_model,
         fontsize = 0.6)
```

The hazard ratio is similar to relative risk, but differs in that the HR is the instantaneous risk rather than the cumulative risk over the entire study. 

The x-axis of this forest plot represents hazard ratios. Hazard ratio = 1 means no significant difference compared to the reference, and a HR higher than 1 means it increases the hazard ratio of the event, death, and a HR lower than 1 decreases it. The smaller the p-value is the stronger the weight of evidence that the two groups are different. 

We can conclude from the plot that for the variable race, blacks have the highest risk of death, followed by whites, while the lowest mortality rate is for other ethnic groups. In the variable marital status, the risk of death is significantly higher for separated people, but this may be due to information bias caused by fewer observations. The confidence intervals for the other categories of marital status all contain the null hypothesis, meaning that there is no significant difference.

The risk of death is highest for patients with N stage N3, followed by N2, and finally N1. Differently, although T stage also shows a similar trend, the confidence intervals of each stage level contain the null hypothesis, meaning that there is no significant difference between levels. For the 6th stage, IIIB has the highest risk of death, followed by IIB, and then IIA, but there is no significant difference. For stage IIIC, since it contains the same information as N3 of N stage, no comparison is made in this variable.

In the variable differentiated, the risk of death is significantly highest for undifferentiated, and then decreases in the order of poorly differentiated, moderately differentiated, and well differentiated.

For the variables tumor size, regional node examined, and reginol node postive, we did not observe significant differences in the risk of death.
